About Me
Hello! I am John Doe, a passionate web developer with a love for creative coding. I enjoy exploring new technologies and sometimes make mistakes, but I always learn from them like forgetting semicolons. I also like experimenting with superscript and subscript in my code, and using <code> tags in HTML.
